# Password Generator

This project is a **Password Generator** built using Python. It was created as a part of my **20-day Python challenge**, where I aimed to improve my Python skills by building small yet practical projects.

## Features
- Generates **strong and secure passwords**
- Allows customization of password **length** and **character types** (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
- Ensures **randomness** for enhanced security
- Simple and **user-friendly** command-line interface

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-generator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd password-generator
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```sh
   python password_generator.py
   ```

## Usage
- Run the script and follow the prompts to generate a password.
- Customize the password by choosing the length and character set.
- Copy and use the generated password securely.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (random, string libraries for secure password generation)

## Future Enhancements
- Add a **GUI version** for better usability
- Implement a **password strength checker**
- Provide an option to **store passwords securely**
